Sorry, this is not the nicest piece of code. However it seems to work. Feel free to improve.

# WDstatements
## What is this? 
*WDstatements* ia a helper tool for pre-processing data which will later be added to Wikidata using QuickStatements (https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/quick_statements.php).
*QuickStatements* can add statements (with optional qualifiers and sources) to Wikidata items via a batch mode.

## Why this?
Even if *QuickStatements* is very powerful however it requires a careful preparation of input data. *WDstatements* will create a string which you can later copy&paste into the *QuickStatements* interface.

## Language Note	
The tool has been pre-configurated for the use of German labels and descriptions. Please change the line *var LANGUAGE="de";* inside the javascript file if you prefer another language.

## Does WDstatements need to comply with any requirements?
Yes, it need. But it should be much easier to comply with these requirements than those of QuickStatements.
- Raw data must have csv format. Alternatly you can copy&paste some cells from your calc application like Open Office Calc, MS Excel, Google Calc, Gnumeric, etc.
- The first column must have the title *item* (in lower case). The cells in this columns contain *subject* (semantically spoken). This could be a known Wikidata object (like *Q42*) or a String (like *Douglas Adams*).
- All other column titles must be named after a valid property with {German} label (like *ist ein(e)*) or the property code (like "P31" in Upper case).
- Columns for label information should be named following the QuickStatements rules (e.g. "Lde" for label in German, "Dde" for description in German or "Ade" for alternate label in German)
- There are special rules for column titles if we have source information or qualifier information stored in this column. For source information use "S" instead of "P" inside the property code (like "S248"). Furthermore we need to add the parent property to which the source refer. This will be done by adding the parent property code as suffix together with a dot (like "P31.S248"). In this case the parent property must be noted as code.
- The same procedure is needed for qualifier information. In this case the child property code keeps his "P". Here is an example: "P159.P969" means property "address" (P969) as a qualifier to the property "headquarters location" (P159)
- It would be useful if the columns containing the parent properties are lefter than their respective child properties. 
- String values inside the table should not be quoted ("" or ''). But they may have some apostrophes inside (L'Ã©cole)
- Date values can be written in multiple ways. For full dates use *dd.mm.yyyy* or *dd/mm/yyyy*. You can also use single digit values for month and day (d.y.yyyy) but the year value must have four digits and the Gregorian calendar is used. If you don't know the day you can use mm/yyyy or mm.yyyy. But you can not use the month by his name!
- WDstatements will lockup for WikibaseItems using the label you will give as a string. For this it will be helpful if your search term are nether too broad nor too narrow. If it's too broad the lockup will retrieve too much results. If it's too narrow you may retrieve nothing and create an unwanted duplicate item.
- Quantity statements and coordinates are not yet implemented. Sorry for that.

## How to use?
- Just download the code store the unzipped folder somewhere where you may find it later again. Then open the file *statements.html* in your broser. It has been tested in current versions of Firefox and Chrome.
- Open the input csv file or cope&paste the data from your tab calc application. Then click on "ProcessData"!
- Now just wait and see. The tool tries to lookup for WikibaseItems. You will see a count down in the upper left corner.
- Usually this will end with a message that a number of items still need be specified.
- You will now see cells in different colors. 
	- Green: The cell is ready. There is nothing more to do.
	- Red: The tool has found some WikibaseItems which could match the label. Left click on the label to select the right one. 
		- If you don't see a list, click on "requery"! (The list will be visible only at the first appearance of the label)
		- If you see your item, click on it. The label will change by the item code and become green.
		- If you can't find your item, click on "create"!. The label color will change to blue.
		- If you believe that the provided label has some errors, click on "Modify this" and change the label. After this, left click on "Requery"! You can also enter the Wikidata code of the item as a short way solution. If you use "Modify all", all labels with the same title will be modified at the same way. Be careful with this option!
		- If you want to ignore the information click on "Hide". The label color will change to grey. If you hide the item at the first column, then the entire item will be ignored. Otherwise it's just one claim who will be ignored.
	- Blue: The tool didn't find a matching item label item. The item will be created.
	- Hide: You decided to hide this information.
- You now need to change all cell labels into green, blue or grey color. After this click on "Start output for QuickStatements"!
	- If you have a blue label in another than the firt column you will be asked to first create these item using QuickStatements. Do so and requery than the blue labels again.
	- If you don't have blue labels or if the blue labels are only in the first column you will now get a result string which you can copy&paste into QuickStatements. 

**Please check the result string carefully before you may paste it into the QuickStatements interface, because nobody is perfect!**
